# Dataset Files

The following files contain datasets that were used to test/sample the py50 python script. They were also used to
sample/test the py50 streamlit application and are provided here for others. There are four files used to test the
different variations for plotting curves. The other datasets are freely available and were obtained
from [Seaborn](https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn-data) and
[Pingouin](https://github.com/raphaelvallat/pingouin/tree/main/src/pingouin/datasets) python modules.
